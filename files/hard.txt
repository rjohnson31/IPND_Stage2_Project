The Brewer-Nash Model, or “Chinese Wall” Model is a security policy model designed to prevent conflicts of interest.  It was first introduced in 1989 by Dr. David Brewer and Dr. Michael Nash and was originally designed with financial services organizations in mind.  It proposed a framework for avoiding conflicts of interest by combining “commercial discretion with legally enforceable mandatory controls.”  It does this by effectively “walling” off areas that create the possibility of a conflict of interest.  According to Brewer and Nash’s initial paper in 1989, this model is built on the idea that there are three main “levels” of classification for objects.  At the top level is the “conflict of interest class,” which can be used to identify separate industries or services within which there may be competition (e.g., banks, oil companies, etc.).  Under the conflict of interest class, we find the stakeholder datasets, such as individual companies competing within the class.  Finally, under each of the stakeholders are the “individual objects,” such as company specific information, documents or resources.
