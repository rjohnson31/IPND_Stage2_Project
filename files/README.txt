README.txt 

The files in this folder are meant to be used with fill-in-the-blanks.py.

Currently, the files must be in a folder named "files" within the same folder 
	as the program file.

The names of the files are required to be easy.txt, medium.txt and hard.txt.

The content of the files is editable.  It is meant to be a passage or paragraph 
	with words taken from the passage to be removed for a fill-in-the-blanks exercise.
	There must be only one occurence of the string "*****" to "split" the "study words", 
	which should be at the top separated by a space, and the paragraph, which should 
	follow the string.  See below for an example.

	SAMPLE OF ACCEPTABLE FILE CONTENTS-----

	mind asterisks blank passage arigatou
	*****
	This is a passage.  It can be as long as you want, but keep in mind that this is a
	fill-in-the-blanks exercise and most/all instances of the words listed above the 
	asterisks will be replaced with a blank for a user to complete!  Therefore, I strongly
	recommend keeping it to a paragraph or two!  You could also do definitions by following 
	a similar formatting to arigatou - "Thanks"
